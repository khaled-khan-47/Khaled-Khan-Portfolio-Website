This is my personal portfolio website. Created from scratch using React.
My website has four pages: Home, About, Projects and Connect
It has a minimal grey design. This is my first time building a website.

Key Challenges:
    Setting up react environment and page navigation, you will need to become familiar with how React Router works.
    Styling - CSS is not always intuitive, I recommend to keep it simple, that way it is easy to understand and fix issues... You can always update it once you have a minimum viable product.

v1: 20th November, 2024:
    My first version of the website, to go live on the web. Very simple, minimal viable product.

    Next steps: 
        Flexible styling and reformatting to support all screen sizes.
        Restyling "About Page", at the moment it is just heading and text in boxes... I should make it more interactive and add pictures.
        Re-organising components and using JSON for data - I have some repeated code in this project which I need to organise and I also want to clean up my js files by using JSON to store data, this will be especially useful for the projects page as I fill it up, as each one will have the same format just different data.
